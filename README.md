## Introduction:
Welcome to Nova Sparks Project, an innovative solution that aims to support road transport system by detecting damage in roads using **Machine Learning** models. This README provides essential information to understand, use, and contribute to the project.

## Modules Used:
The project relies on the following key modules:

- Yolo v.8
- Spring Boot
- Roboflow
- PyTorch
- MySQL
- Bing Map API

Make sure to review the documentation for each module for detailed information on their functionality and usage.

## Methodology
### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Objective:** Collect a dataset of image samples of roads.
- **Actions:**
  - Collect diverse images of road conditions.
  - Cleanse and map the target areas in each image for accurate training.

### Step 2: Model Building with YOLO v8 and PyTorch
- **Objective:** Develop an effective model for road damage detection.
- **Actions:**
  - Utilize PyTorch along with YOLO v8 architecture for building and training the model.
  - Incorporate metrics such as box loss to assess model performance.

### Step 3: Dataset Enhancement with Roboflow
- **Objective:** Improve dataset quality for enhanced model training.
- **Actions:**
  - Use Roboflow for plotting and mapping, enhancing the dataset for better efficiency.

### Step 4: Web Application Development with Spring Boot
- **Objective:** Create a user-friendly web application for road damage reporting.
- **Actions:**
  - Develop a sample web application using the Spring Boot framework.
  - Implement functionality for users to upload images.
  - Detect road damage in uploaded images and process relevant data.
  - Store processed data in a MySQL database.
  
### Step 5: Government Awareness Integration
- **Objective:** Raise awareness by notifying government authorities of detected road damage.
- **Actions:**
  - Establish a mechanism to forward detected images and relevant information to government authorities.

Ensure that you follow the recommended steps to successfully deploy and use the project.

## User Instruction:
- We have implemented bing map api in our application whiich will identify the location of the user and will help to send details with location to government with ease. So Users are maade aware of this feature.
- Photos are uploaded must be in good quality.
- Any queries in applications can be given in the website.

## Future Ideas:
  - Our strategic initiative involves creating and putting into operation a state-of-the-art machine learning model for detecting road damage. This effort shall result in the development of a complex model using
advanced technologies like YOLO v8 and PyTorch. Specifically, this model will be deployed for real-time monitoring on school buses. Ultimately, its main aim is to pre-warn law enforcement agencies by identifying potential road damages in good time so as to enhance safety and security of school bus transportation system. Inclusion of this machine learning model into the school buses will be seamless, as we hope to make a safer transportation ecosystem for students, hence providing them with a robust intelligent solution towards monitoring real-time condition of roads.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, Our project may represent a significant leap forward in **Detecting Road Damages**. We believe that this project has the potential to reduce the disturbances in road tranportations. Thank you for your interest and contributions.
